Below is a detailed implementation plan that outlines every change and addition with file-level steps, error handling, UI/UX considerations, and realistic feature sets for a Mac Donalds–ordering app built in your Next.js codebase.

---

## 1. Global Styling and Navigation

- **File:** `src/app/globals.css`  
  - Add global CSS classes for ordering layouts (grid for menu items, flex for item details and cart summary).  
  - Define typography, spacing, and color variables to ensure a modern, clean look.

- **New File:** `src/components/ordering/Header.tsx`  
  - Create a header component that renders a simple navigation bar with text links for “Home,” “Menu,” and “Cart.”  
  - Use semantic HTML, modern typography, and spacing (no external icon libraries).  
  - Ensure responsive design with CSS media queries or flex properties.

---

## 2. Centralized Cart State Management

- **New File:** `src/context/CartContext.tsx`  
  - Implement a React Context to maintain the cart state (an array of cart items plus add, remove, and update functions).  
  - Use proper TypeScript types for items and provide try/catch blocks where asynchronous updates occur.  
  - Wrap the overall layout (or add the provider in `src/app/layout.tsx` if created) so all pages may access the cart state.

---

## 3. API Endpoints

- **Menu API**  
  - **File:** `src/app/api/menu/route.ts`  
    - Handle GET requests to return a static list of sample menu items (e.g. “Big Mac”, “McChicken”, “Fries”) including id, name, description, price, and an image URL.  
    - Use error handling (check the HTTP method, wrap data retrieval in try/catch, and return a 500 status on error).

- **Order API**  
  - **File:** `src/app/api/order/route.ts`  
    - Accept POST requests with the order payload (list of items, quantities, and any customization).  
    - Validate the request body, simulate order processing, and return a confirmation JSON.  
    - Ensure proper error status codes if validation fails.

---

## 4. Menu and Item Detail Pages

- **Menu Page**  
  - **File:** `src/app/menu/page.tsx`  
    - Create a client component that fetches menu items from `/api/menu` via useEffect.  
    - Map each item to a new UI component called `OrderItemCard` (see next section).  
    - Display a loading or error state if fetching fails.

- **Item Detail Page**  
  - **File:** `src/app/item/[itemId]/page.tsx`  
    - Create a dynamic route that fetches information about a single item based on the URL parameter.  
    - Render item details with a larger image, description, and a list of customizable options using an `ItemCustomization` component.  
    - Include an “Add to Cart” button that calls the `addItem` method from the CartContext.  
    - Handle errors when fetching item details (e.g. invalid id or network failure).

---

## 5. Cart and Checkout Page

- **Cart Page**  
  - **File:** `src/app/cart/page.tsx`  
    - Create a client component that retrieves the current cart from the CartContext.  
    - Render a detailed list of added items using a new component `CartSummary` with options to update quantity or remove items.  
    - Include a “Checkout” button that, when clicked, sends a POST request to `/api/order` with the cart data and displays order confirmation (simulate order processing).  
    - Add error handling for failed API calls (display a user-friendly error message).

---

## 6. New Ordering UI Components

- **OrderItemCard Component**  
  - **File:** `src/components/ordering/OrderItemCard.tsx`  
    - Render a card-style component with the menu item’s placeholder image (use a URL such as:  
      `https://placehold.co/400x300?text=High+quality+image+of+burger+and+fries`  
      with a descriptive alt text), name, price, and an “Add to Cart” button.  
    - Implement hover states and error handling (if image fails to load, use an `onerror` handler to display a fallback text).

- **ItemCustomization Component**  
  - **File:** `src/components/ordering/ItemCustomization.tsx`  
    - Render options (using checkboxes or buttons) that allow users to add extras (e.g. extra cheese, sauces).  
    - Validate user selections and pass customization options back to the parent page when the “Add to Cart” is clicked.

- **CartSummary Component**  
  - **File:** `src/components/ordering/CartSummary.tsx`  
    - Display each cart item with its image (again using a placeholder if necessary), name, quantity, and individual price.  
    - Summarize the total order cost with a modern layout and clear call-to-action for checkout.  
    - Offer the ability to remove items or update quantities using inline controls.

---

## 7. Home Page Update and Layout Integration

- **File:** `src/app/page.tsx`  
  - Integrate the `Header` component on the top of the home page.  
  - Provide a simple introduction with a call-to-action button linking to `/menu` (styled with the existing button UI).  
  - Maintain consistency with the global styling and ensure all primary navigation is present.

---

## 8. Error Handling and Best Practices

- Ensure every API endpoint uses try/catch and proper HTTP status codes.  
- Validate API responses and log errors to the console for debugging.  
- When making fetch calls in client components (menu page, item detail, cart), check for non-200 responses and display user-friendly errors.  
- Use TypeScript interfaces for menu items, cart items, and order payloads to ensure type safety.  
- Maintain a responsive design using Flexbox/Grid layouts and proper spacing as defined in `globals.css`.

---

## 9. Testing Protocol

- Test the Menu endpoint:  
  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:3000/api/menu
  ```  
- Test order submission using curl:  
  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/order -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"items":[{"id":1,"quantity":2}]}'  
  ```  
- Validate UI flows: menu fetch, item detail display, cart updates, and order submission via browser testing.

---

## Summary

- Updated global styling and created a header for navigation in `globals.css` and `Header.tsx`.  
- Implemented a React Context in `CartContext.tsx` to manage cart state.  
- Developed API endpoints in `/api/menu` and `/api/order` with robust error handling.  
- Built menu, item detail, and cart pages with dynamic fetching and error states.  
- Created ordering UI components (`OrderItemCard.tsx`, `ItemCustomization.tsx`, `CartSummary.tsx`) for a modern, clean interface.  
- Integrated navigation and call-to-action elements in the home page.  
- Ensured type safety, responsive design, and comprehensive user feedback on errors and API responses.
